## Sprint Goals
:white_check_mark: Start #"(Ideas) Memetics Museum" 
⏳️ Draft #"(Draft) Embodied Symbients"  (universal interfaces series)
- [ ] Publish #"(Shelved) Generative QR Codes" to Substack
- [ ] Finish #"(shelved) Generative Paper"  prototype, look for collaborators to contribute a page ideas (6 pages total) 
- [ ] Start a thread on the WebXR memetics WebXR Memetics Museum Collaboration
- [ ] (Draft) Liminal Internet - on the topic of serverless, intelligent websites that "pop into existence"
- [ ] (Draft) Boltzmann Mining - the idea of repurposing old devices to run AIs inside of 24/7

## Sprint Questions
- What does it mean for paper to be computable?
- What does it mean to have free access to AI through QR Codes?
