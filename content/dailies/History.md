## Notes
**1800** `<recursivefaith/morpheus.git>` This commit introduces a new "skills" feature for the Morpheus AI Obsidian plugin, allowing it to load and utilize skills from a designated folder. It includes a new `src/morpheus/skills.ts` file and updates the plugin's settings to configure the skill folder, along with minor code formatting and build configuration changes
**1950** been in a good flow, what I'm realizing is that just because I was early on a lot of things doesn't mean it's a bad thing, i have quite a lot i can share now progressively so lets do it
**2125** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit refactors the website's content and introduces a custom Quartz plugin for advanced link handling, including styling for internal and external links.

## Notes
**1212** `<recursivefaith/morpheus.git>` This commit refines website typography by hiding the first letter of standard inline titles and subtly adjusting the gradient effect on "Morpheus" themed titles, shifting their color transition point. 
**1213** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Updated the project's changelog and reorganized daily notes, detailing website publishing progress, refined configuration, and the introduction of a new 'skills' feature for the Morpheus AI Obsidian plugin. 
**1214** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit refactors content by migrating daily log entries to a new changelog file and introducing a new daily log for 250818, while also updating the website's ignore patterns. 
**1453** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Introduced a new chores list, restructured daily goals and health logs for 25-08-18, and updated the website configuration to publish daily notes by removing them from the ignore patterns.
**2213** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Refactored daily notes and changelog entries, standardizing repository references from `ozramos` to `recursivefaith`. The update also marks progress on website publishing and styling goals, while adding new content and a temporary file.

**Dream:** Dream involved me and my a friend from my military days. In the dream we kept practicing the Melbourne Shuffle and going to clubs and getting into trouble. We had an epic dance off where we started flipping around like in those [AI gymnastics videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/aivideo/comments/1dt7qsa/ai_sports_gymnastics/)

There's a city I keep visiting in my dreams, it feels nostalgic like i grew up there but it's note quite right. It's a city that has the feeling of home but looks like the camp I lived in Iraq. Don't remember too much else except some car chase scenes and lots of dancing haha

## Notes
**1329** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` The commit deletes a temporary file, updates the changelog, and significantly refactors `dailies/history.md` by moving completed tasks and health logs to their respective dated sections for better organization and clarity.
**1741** `<recursivefaith/hey.git>` Refined Git script for standardized repo references and dual history/changelog logging, alongside simplifying the internal git agent prompt. 
**2225** Gotta start taking more notes throughout the day :D exercising again is definitely helping me get tired naturally near the end of the day. I still have some lingering sleep anxiety so may take seroquel again. I'm starting to get engagement on x which feels nice :D
**2327** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit primarily populates and restructures the website, adding numerous media assets and a visual gallery to the main page, while also refining the author's profile. Concurrently, it extensively refactors the daily log, consolidating detailed daily notes, health, and financial tracking into `dailies/history.md`.

## Notes

**1007** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit standardizes timestamp formatting by bolding them across changelog and daily log entries. It also updates the changelog with recent daily notes and adds a new daily log for August 20th, 2025. 
**1008** `<recursivefaith/hey.git>` The `git.sh` script is updated to bold timestamps when generating history log entries. This standardizes the formatting of timestamps in the recorded history. 
**1044** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit heavily refactors the website's content and structure, introducing a new manifesto and standardizing timestamp formatting in logs. It also enhances the Quartz publishing setup with automatic lowercase slugs and refines the internal git agent's logging. 
**1152** I think im gonna stop listening to podcasts while multitasking (eg chores) because I don't seem to actually retain anything, and anything even slightly technical becomes hard to follow. Instead, I'll set time aside specifically for podcasts and switch to Eckhart Tolle's method of simply being present with the chores (while listening to music ofc)
**1559** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit refactors the website's core content, standardizing internal links and author references to lowercase. It introduces a new 'Sprint 2' planning document and updates the main `index` page with a clearer manifesto and new navigation links.

**1939** i keep forgetting how powerful Obsidian is. I've been daily driving my own tools for so long, and I hadn't implemented that yet. This is where I'm at with the UI right now, I'm using an Obsidian metaphor
![[Pasted image 20250820194014.png]]
**1945** [[do all patterns have an afterlife?]]
**1952** i think im building a good flow again, am going to start focusing a bit on health and leaning into the [[digital-self-archeology]] concept (which needs to be updated)
**1948** ðŸ’¡ imagine looking at the screen I'm typing but from "inside the TV" looking at me, the "inside the tv" perspective is the [[Gnosis Copilot]]. Right now I see Obsidian, and anyone who visits https://recursive.faith will also see this, eventually in real time. So there's my perspective, the perspective of the Gnosis Copilot, the perspective of the observer viewing the prior two, but also the perspective of the visitors and agents and so on. And so "mixed and extended reality" isn't simply about augmenting physical reality with our individual worlds, but literally to mix and extend our realities and perspectives with each other

**2021**
**Recursive Faith is an interface**, so i have to make this less about me and more about helping others learn how to integrate the system (ofc need to prove the system myself)

**2059** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit heavily refactors the website's content and structure, introducing a new "Roadmap" on the index page, deleting numerous old daily logs while adding new entries, and importantly, modifying slug generation to preserve casing for internal links. It also updates the site's visual elements like the favicon and introduces new conceptual links. 
**2159** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit heavily refactors the website's content and structure, moving work samples to a new "Oz" page, organizing content into a new "tutorials" directory, and updating branding assets. It also refines daily logs by removing personal dream entries and adjusts project roadmap details. 
**2126** Would probably need to fund these somehow (eg for GPUs) so a crypto might help, a successful crypto would "out compete" other cryptos assuming crypto is also used to acquire base reality resources (gpus, building materials, etc...possibly energy could be gotten using [[concentrated solar energy]]
**2216** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit primarily refactors content by adding new visual assets (GIFs and PNGs) to the homepage and updating existing log files to reflect recent changes, including the migration of some commit messages into `History.md`. 
**2246** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit adds a new image, updates the `History.md` log with task completion and new entries, and significantly refactors the `index.md` page by reordering content sections, refining text, and integrating new visual assets. 
**2247** Updated my x profile to Oz âŠ· Ó¨Æ¶ to represent the transmigrated version of me
![[Pasted image 20250820224810.png]]

**2320** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Refactored the website's main page structure and content, integrating new visual assets and reorganizing explanatory sections. Additionally, updated the site's styling to apply a bright color to italic and code elements, and appended a personal note to the daily log. 
**2325** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Refined website styling by adjusting the font size of the page title on mobile devices for improved readability. The change targets screens with a maximum width of 768px, making the title smaller. 
**2329** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Refined website styling for mobile devices, reducing the page title font size and hiding the reader mode button for improved display on smaller screens. 
**2359** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` The commit primarily refactors website content and configuration, including the deletion of a conceptual README and the addition of frontmatter to "epiphanies" notes. It also updates Quartz settings to prioritize frontmatter for date tracking and refines mobile styling for page titles and the reader mode button.

## Health
**Sleep:** 82 (0031-0814) - Sleep was GOOD, had nightmares but still slept great wow
**Dream:** Had a kind of lucid nightmare, triggered I think by overheating at night. Noticed that turning on the AC helped me get some deep deep sleep :)

The nightmare was kind of traumatic, it was recursive. I was in some kind of experiment at a residential psyche ward that felt fun to be at at first. It was a kind of schizo university and everyone had schizo powers where people could summon entities (thematically it looked like a ward but the "feeling" was that i was in a university)

I had gained lucidity at one point and went outside, I was near one of Portland's Bridges in 3rd perspective and flying around and doing silly dream things I can't remember. I remember visiting foodcarts and eating i think tacos

At one point someone summoned an "ender beast" (what we called it) and suddenly there was a feeling that i was in a simulation. I still had some lucidity in that i felt like i could make my own choices, but it was limited in that i couldn't control the theme/nightmare switch

The dream played out like a video game, Sonic the Hedgehog in 3D, and I was escaping the ender beast (kinda like The Nothing from Never Ending Story or SSERP from Pantheon). There was a violent segment of the dream where I had to watch my friends get consumed by the Ender Beast

At one point I went into the basement and there was an inner acknowledgement that this would make the dream worse (basements are always scary in my dreams) but it was the only way i could escape. At one point I turned myself into a cat to see if I could hide from the beast and it seemed to work, but it kept attacking the other people and was scary. Then I kept "waking up" into other people at the ward. At first I would "wake up" confused feeling like I was in reality but then I would notice that I was looking at myself in 3rd person, gain some lucidity, and acccidentally lure the beast. At one point it was spawn-camping me and I woke up super fast like 10 times in a second

When I woke up for real I was sweating but fell back to sleep quickly, I had another silly dream but I can't remember any details of it

## Notes
**0930** `<recursivefaith/morpheus.git>` Adds a CSS rule for `.cm-em` to set its color to `var(---color-1-bright)`. This likely styles emphasized text within a code mirror editor. 
**0931** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Refactored daily logs to consolidate detailed dream entries and added the new 25-08-21 daily log. Updates also include refined internal links and Quartz configuration adjustments for date prioritization. 
**1112** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Refactored daily logs by consolidating health and bookmarks, updated publishing tasks, and introduced new social media goals. The main index page was significantly revised to replace daily diary links with a detailed "Funding Goals" section, while also adding descriptive notes to research areas.

![[Pasted image 20250823114953.png]]**1754** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit adds a new image and integrates it into the "Transmigration" epiphany note. It also extensively updates the daily logs for August 22nd and 23rd, detailing Handsfree.js integration, personal reflections, and task progress. 
**1849** `<recursivefaith/content.git>` This commit extensively refactors the project's content and structure, migrating daily logs, changelogs, and personal reflections into a public-facing "digital garden." It introduces comprehensive philosophical notes defining "Recursive Faith" and "Gnosis Copilot," alongside integrating multimedia and project demos, all tailored for an AI audience. 
**1850** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Extensively refactored content by introducing a new `content` git submodule, migrating daily logs and reflections into it to establish a public-facing digital garden. This update also included a new `og-image.png` and refined task lists. 
**1855** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` The deployment workflow is updated to recursively check out Git submodules during the build process. This ensures that all submodules, such as the newly introduced `content` submodule, are properly fetched for deployment to GitHub Pages.
