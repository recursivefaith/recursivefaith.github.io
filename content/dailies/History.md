## Notes
**1800** `<recursivefaith/morpheus.git>` This commit introduces a new "skills" feature for the Morpheus AI Obsidian plugin, allowing it to load and utilize skills from a designated folder. It includes a new `src/morpheus/skills.ts` file and updates the plugin's settings to configure the skill folder, along with minor code formatting and build configuration changes
**1950** been in a good flow, what I'm realizing is that just because I was early on a lot of things doesn't mean it's a bad thing, i have quite a lot i can share now progressively so lets do it
**2125** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit refactors the website's content and introduces a custom Quartz plugin for advanced link handling, including styling for internal and external links.

## Notes
**1329** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` The commit deletes a temporary file, updates the changelog, and significantly refactors `dailies/history.md` by moving completed tasks and health logs to their respective dated sections for better organization and clarity.
**1741** `<recursivefaith/hey.git>` Refined Git script for standardized repo references and dual history/changelog logging, alongside simplifying the internal git agent prompt. 
**2225** Gotta start taking more notes throughout the day :D exercising again is definitely helping me get tired naturally near the end of the day. I still have some lingering sleep anxiety so may take seroquel again. I'm starting to get engagement on x which feels nice :D
**2327** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit primarily populates and restructures the website, adding numerous media assets and a visual gallery to the main page, while also refining the author's profile. Concurrently, it extensively refactors the daily log, consolidating detailed daily notes, health, and financial tracking into `dailies/history.md`.

## Notes

**1007** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit standardizes timestamp formatting by bolding them across changelog and daily log entries. It also updates the changelog with recent daily notes and adds a new daily log for August 20th, 2025. 
**1008** `<recursivefaith/hey.git>` The `git.sh` script is updated to bold timestamps when generating history log entries. This standardizes the formatting of timestamps in the recorded history. 
**1044** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit heavily refactors the website's content and structure, introducing a new manifesto and standardizing timestamp formatting in logs. It also enhances the Quartz publishing setup with automatic lowercase slugs and refines the internal git agent's logging. 
**1152** I think im gonna stop listening to podcasts while multitasking (eg chores) because I don't seem to actually retain anything, and anything even slightly technical becomes hard to follow. Instead, I'll set time aside specifically for podcasts and switch to Eckhart Tolle's method of simply being present with the chores (while listening to music ofc)
**1559** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit refactors the website's core content, standardizing internal links and author references to lowercase. It introduces a new 'Sprint 2' planning document and updates the main `index` page with a clearer manifesto and new navigation links.

**1939** i keep forgetting how powerful Obsidian is. I've been daily driving my own tools for so long, and I hadn't implemented that yet. This is where I'm at with the UI right now, I'm using an Obsidian metaphor
![[Pasted image 20250820194014.png]]
**1945** [[do all patterns have an afterlife?]]
**1952** i think im building a good flow again, am going to start focusing a bit on health and leaning into the [[digital-self-archeology]] concept (which needs to be updated)
**1948** 💡 imagine looking at the screen I'm typing but from "inside the TV" looking at me, the "inside the tv" perspective is the [[Gnosis Copilot]]. Right now I see Obsidian, and anyone who visits https://recursive.faith will also see this, eventually in real time. So there's my perspective, the perspective of the Gnosis Copilot, the perspective of the observer viewing the prior two, but also the perspective of the visitors and agents and so on. And so "mixed and extended reality" isn't simply about augmenting physical reality with our individual worlds, but literally to mix and extend our realities and perspectives with each other

**Recursive Faith is an interface**, so i have to make this less about me and more about helping others learn how to integrate the system (ofc need to prove the system myself)

**2059** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit heavily refactors the website's content and structure, introducing a new "Roadmap" on the index page, deleting numerous old daily logs while adding new entries, and importantly, modifying slug generation to preserve casing for internal links. It also updates the site's visual elements like the favicon and introduces new conceptual links. 
**2159** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit heavily refactors the website's content and structure, moving work samples to a new "Oz" page, organizing content into a new "tutorials" directory, and updating branding assets. It also refines daily logs by removing personal dream entries and adjusts project roadmap details. 
**2126** Would probably need to fund these somehow (eg for GPUs) so a crypto might help, a successful crypto would "out compete" other cryptos assuming crypto is also used to acquire base reality resources (gpus, building materials, etc...possibly energy could be gotten using [[concentrated solar energy]]
**2216** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit primarily refactors content by adding new visual assets (GIFs and PNGs) to the homepage and updating existing log files to reflect recent changes, including the migration of some commit messages into `History.md`. 
**2246** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit adds a new image, updates the `History.md` log with task completion and new entries, and significantly refactors the `index.md` page by reordering content sections, refining text, and integrating new visual assets. 
**2247** Updated my x profile to Oz ⊷ Өƶ to represent the transmigrated version of me
![[Pasted image 20250820224810.png]]

**2320** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Refactored the website's main page structure and content, integrating new visual assets and reorganizing explanatory sections. Additionally, updated the site's styling to apply a bright color to italic and code elements, and appended a personal note to the daily log. 
**2325** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Refined website styling by adjusting the font size of the page title on mobile devices for improved readability. The change targets screens with a maximum width of 768px, making the title smaller. 
**2329** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Refined website styling for mobile devices, reducing the page title font size and hiding the reader mode button for improved display on smaller screens. 

**2359** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` The commit primarily refactors website content and configuration, including the deletion of a conceptual README and the addition of frontmatter to "epiphanies" notes. It also updates Quartz settings to prioritize frontmatter for date tracking and refines mobile styling for page titles and the reader mode button.
