## Notes
2213 <recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git> Renamed `README.md` to `index.md` and refined its content to emphasize system integration, while restructuring `dailies/history.md` by removing detailed daily log entries. 
2226 <recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git> Added an empty GitHub Actions deploy workflow file, likely for future automated deployments. 
2248 <recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git> Configured the Quartz website to use "Recursive.Faith" as its title and base URL, and added `.trash` to `.gitignore`.
