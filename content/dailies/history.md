**2059** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit heavily refactors the website's content and structure, introducing a new "Roadmap" on the index page, deleting numerous old daily logs while adding new entries, and importantly, modifying slug generation to preserve casing for internal links. It also updates the site's visual elements like the favicon and introduces new conceptual links.
