## Notes
2213 <recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git> Renamed `README.md` to `index.md` and refined its content to emphasize system integration, while restructuring `dailies/history.md` by removing detailed daily log entries. 
2226 <recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git> Added an empty GitHub Actions deploy workflow file, likely for future automated deployments. 
2248 <recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git> Configured the Quartz website to use "Recursive.Faith" as its title and base URL, and added `.trash` to `.gitignore`.

1800 `<recursivefaith/morpheus.git>` This commit introduces a new "skills" feature for the Morpheus AI Obsidian plugin, allowing it to load and utilize skills from a designated folder. It includes a new `src/morpheus/skills.ts` file and updates the plugin's settings to configure the skill folder, along with minor code formatting and build configuration changes.
