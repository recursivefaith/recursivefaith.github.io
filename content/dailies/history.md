2226 <recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git> Added an empty GitHub Actions deploy workflow file, likely for future automated deployments. 
2248 <recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git> Configured the Quartz website to use "Recursive.Faith" as its title and base URL, and added `.trash` to `.gitignore`.
