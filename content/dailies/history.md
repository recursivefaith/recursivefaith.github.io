## Notes
2213 <ozramos/recursivefaith.github.io.git> Renamed `README.md` to `index.md` and refined its content to emphasize system integration, while restructuring `dailies/history.md` by removing detailed daily log entries. 
2226 <ozramos/recursivefaith.github.io.git> Added an empty GitHub Actions deploy workflow file, likely for future automated deployments.
