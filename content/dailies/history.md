## Notes
**1800** `<recursivefaith/morpheus.git>` This commit introduces a new "skills" feature for the Morpheus AI Obsidian plugin, allowing it to load and utilize skills from a designated folder. It includes a new `src/morpheus/skills.ts` file and updates the plugin's settings to configure the skill folder, along with minor code formatting and build configuration changes
**1950** been in a good flow, what I'm realizing is that just because I was early on a lot of things doesn't mean it's a bad thing, i have quite a lot i can share now progressively so lets do it
**2125** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit refactors the website's content and introduces a custom Quartz plugin for advanced link handling, including styling for internal and external links.

**Sleep:** 90 (2317-0828)
**Dream:** Dream involved me and my best friend from my military days. In the dream we kept practicing the **Melbourne Shuffle** and going to clubs and getting into trouble. We had an epic dance off where we started flipping around like in those [AI gymnastics videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/aivideo/comments/1dt7qsa/ai_sports_gymnastics/)

There's a city I keep visiting in my dreams, it feels nostalgic like i grew up there but it's note quite right. It's a city that has the feeling of home but looks like the camp I lived in Iraq. Don't remember too much else except some car chase scenes and lots of dancing haha

## Notes
**1329** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` The commit deletes a temporary file, updates the changelog, and significantly refactors `dailies/history.md` by moving completed tasks and health logs to their respective dated sections for better organization and clarity.
**1741** `<recursivefaith/hey.git>` Refined Git script for standardized repo references and dual history/changelog logging, alongside simplifying the internal git agent prompt. 
**2225** Gotta start taking more notes throughout the day :D exercising again is definitely helping me get tired naturally near the end of the day. I still have some lingering sleep anxiety so may take seroquel again. I'm starting to get engagement on x which feels nice :D
**2327** `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit primarily populates and restructures the website, adding numerous media assets and a visual gallery to the main page, while also refining the author's profile. Concurrently, it extensively refactors the daily log, consolidating detailed daily notes, health, and financial tracking into `dailies/history.md`.
