## Notes
1800 `<recursivefaith/morpheus.git>` This commit introduces a new "skills" feature for the Morpheus AI Obsidian plugin, allowing it to load and utilize skills from a designated folder. It includes a new `src/morpheus/skills.ts` file and updates the plugin's settings to configure the skill folder, along with minor code formatting and build configuration changes

1214 `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` This commit refactors content by migrating daily log entries to a new changelog file and introducing a new daily log for 250818, while also updating the website's ignore patterns. 
1453 `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Introduced a new chores list, restructured daily goals and health logs for 25-08-18, and updated the website configuration to publish daily notes by removing them from the ignore patterns. 2213 `<recursivefaith/recursivefaith.github.io.git>` Refactored daily notes and changelog entries, standardizing repository references from `ozramos` to `recursivefaith`.
