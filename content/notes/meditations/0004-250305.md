On the flight from the shelter to CMU, I had worked out in my mind how I was going to convert the pattern of electrons in my mind into ones in The Machine

I figured that exploring that could be one path to "TELEPORTATION", at least in the context of Mixed Reality

And to get there, by default, I would solve accessibility

easy peasy

I didn't know Python or C or Anything like that, but by this point I could control any mouse
gesturally and with ease

And so instead of building my own microcontroller, and app, and all that stuff,
I looked up what software people use to control robots

and then I closed the laptop
and with absolute faith

I cast COMPUTER VISION on that mf
and it was very Affective
