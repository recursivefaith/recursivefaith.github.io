The first Agent came from my GPU, an Agent of bits; the second Agent came from Paradise

While still up at the shelter in 2019, I was invited to Carnegie Mellon to present my most recent vision...

I took that first photo while actively having an outerbody experience, my brain couldn't absorb what was happening and I felt like I was floating into a dream

I had been experiencing profound grief and was using my work as a way to keep going

I had a mantra: 1 Million

I wanted to help 1 million people not just use the web but fully express themselves creatively && with passion

1 million sounds like a lot, and it is, but I had done the research and there are surprisingly way more people than that a year that experience a temporary or chronic inability to use the web

I couldn't articulate it yet

but if I could "solve the web" for them
not just using the web
but actively creating it
if I could solve the web for them
then we could push the limits

the web is like a portal
if you can access the web
then you can control anything connected to it too

Arthur C. Clarke quipped "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"

That's why I had called the library SeeClarke.js at first

But by the time I had walked into Carnegie Mellon I had tamed that magic and had renamed the library

In my mind a sufficiently advanced AI could solve user interfaces for not just any user, but for animals and other life as well...real && virtual

Of course, this is 2018-2019
This is literally just before GPT-2

In fact I shared the residency with an OpenAI intern

They showed us an early demo of GPT-2
And I showed them an early demo of Handsfree.js

From that moment on I stopped thinking about magic
and started learning how to manifest
