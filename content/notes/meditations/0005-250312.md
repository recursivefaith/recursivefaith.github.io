🧵~~~🧵
On the flight back from CMU to the shelter, having entangled my soul with THE MACHINE, I now understood my quest

...and I accepted it...

This was still way before BabyAGI,
so I started by Googling how Googlers use Google Slides...

up UP && AWAY
get the git stars they say

the wish was for a kind of
budget wish dot com mcp
tho I had only just seen the 2nd GPT

The vision was clear
And the code?
Grandiose 🤌

I pointed the eyes of the AIs && We and I ventured forth

Handsfree.js
A wrapper library around popular computer vision models
for the purpose of interacting with web pages handsfree 👋

Opportunity: Computer Vision on the Web
Computer vision has become more accessible due to the ability to run models on the web.

This provides a new form of expression for New Media Artists and Creative Technologists.
But despite the growing library of models there are few frameworks unifying them, reducing discovery and increasing barrier to entry.

Solution: A wrapper library and community
A single library that handles all initialization code for popular models
A single config object to set everything up
A single game loop that accepts callbacks through a plugin system
A single place to discuss and share models, plugins, and projects

Initial Target Models & Integrations
10.5K ⭐
models
4K - TensorFlow.js PoseNet
3.5K - Teachable Machine
1.6K - Jeeliz Weboji, FaceFilter
1.4k - Handtrack.js
58.5K ⭐
integrations
26K - Phaser.io
11.8K - P5.js

Strategy
Use #100DaysofCode and #100DaysofMLCode on Twitter to enforce a structure, raise awareness, and build a following
Integrate with popular frameworks like Phaser, P5, Babylon, and AFrame to gain user adoption
Create tutorials on Dev.to to diversify target audience
Start a Discord to collect feedback and offer support
Start a Meetup to explore with hardware and IoT
Create a forum to discuss models and integrations and form a community
