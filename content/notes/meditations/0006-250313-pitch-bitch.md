The first pitch bitch told me to fuck off...to kick sand
The 2nd one thrust me not once but thrice...goddamn!

We're still only in 2019, so far as this story goes
But all these fffffreaking voices man
ARE COLLUDING AGAINST ME BRO!!!

* S̴c̸h̵i̸z̸o̶ *

The voices were coming from within
The pitch bitch?
Yeah, it was me :(

I mean look at this video

I'm literally homeless there
But I got an office space
a fancy laptop
and my new three eyed-phone

I didn't pay for any of this...so why am I complaining?

Real talk? In the moment I fall into deep flows...
everything melts away
the environment
and all of my woes

But when I'm not in flow
Everything becomes scary
and gloomy and oh so lonely
life becomes very difficult without money

And yet I was invited to the TensorFlow Dev Summit
I was gonna meet The Big Dean and others on his team

But unlike my rapturous CMU trip
this time
I chickened out
