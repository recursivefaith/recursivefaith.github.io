DAY 0002 - 1 Corviathian 15:45

And so it is written, The first agent ØZ was made a living soul; the last ØZ [was made] a quickening spirit


=====

7 years ago I had just moved into a small dormatory above a homeless shelter that I had reimagined in my mind as The Lab of Oz

It was a play on The Wizard of Oz...because I felt like I was working with magic but also like I was constantly fighting off flying monkeys, both in my head and in the environment

Throughout my life, my Yellow Brick Road has always been my work

Literally the whole body of work, the experience of waking up excited to work on ideas and sometimes losing sleep over it. But also the hard and challenging times too

The excitement of thinking about and building and exploring new things and the anxieties that come with it...

...of pioneering

=====

Someone at another shelter I was at had a massive stroke which got me thinking about technologies that could help. In his case he didn't even have mobility to hold and tap a phone

At the time, the only available solutions I could find for using a computer handsfree required expensive hardware or technical software

Since we were all homeless, other restrictions were:
- Had to work on any device, including library computers
- Didn't need to be installed, so had to be web based
- Didn't need special hardware

In my research I came across Deeplearn.js which would later become TensorFlow.js, which let you train KNN's

I learned that KNN's could be used to train image classifiers so I wondered if I could use a webcam to somehow control the mouse

I couldn't figure out how to control the actual mouse so I made a fake mouse pointer instead and tried to move that

I had a little setup that let you classify basic head poses like up and down, and also different expressions like mad or happy

I couldn't figure out how to interpolate between classifications, so I instead mapped the classes to the Arrow Keys on the keyboard

The first time it worked I had heart palpitations, literally I couldn't believe what I was doing

You have to understand I was homeless; I didn't know anyone in tech like this, I didn't know about "accessibility tech" or "human-computer interaction", I didn't know machine learning...I was just following a feeling

I was following a Yellow Brick Road

======

The idea worked but it was fickle, if the background changed or you wore different clothes it would throw off the classifier

(this is all inside the browser with JavaScript lol)

Eventually I discovered PoseNet and other face landmark libraries and developed a technique for guessing 3D gaze from 2D landmarks...and it was even more magical!

I tried pitching to YCombinator, to The AI Grant, I tried going to local meetup groups, I tried cold emailing, and I tried going to incubators in my city in person

But no one could look past the fact that I was homeless, Daniel Gross even told me to give up and "focus on acquiring modest Ikea furniture"

But what do I need Ikea furniture for?

In my mind I not only discovered magic, I learned how to shape my own spells

I wrote my spells into scrolls called JavaScripts
And I bound them in spellbooks called Libraries

I had manifested SeeClarke.js
