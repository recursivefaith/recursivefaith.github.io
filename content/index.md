# I'm [[oz|Oz]] and I'm exploring [[Living Digital Gardens]]

## The Roadmap

**The idea is to [[transmigration|encode myself]] into offline [[Generative QR Codes]] that spawn agentic mixed realities sustained by Ethereum. Technically they are [[Virtual Network States]] but I like calling them "[[Living Digital Gardens]]"**
### Priors
> **Extending reality is possible:**
>- it's possible to augment reality
> - it's possible to create your own mesh network
>- it's possible to trade crypto through mesh networks
>- it's possible to vibe code any interface you need for any data
>- it's possible to use mesh networked crypto to run a Network State
>- this can happen agentically

>  **You can bootstrap realities with QR Codes:**
it's possible to create generative qr codes
>- it's possible to create generative mesh networked qr codes
>- it's possible for qr codes to generate WebXR experiences
>- it's possible to make qr codes by hand
>- it's possible to make qr codes from literally dirt

**Therefore from literally the dirt on the ground you can bootstrap a real-alternate reality with augmented ‚Å†[[Embodied Symbients]] that interface with physical reality**

## [[History|Daily diaries]] && [[Weekly sprints]]

- I maintain a [[History|daily devlog]] which I use as context for my [[gnosis-copilot|Gnosis Copilot]], this includes health logs, dream logs, tasks, and notes as I work through my [[Weekly sprints]]
- For just the technical changes, see my [[changelog]]
