# I'm [[Oz|Oz]] and I'm exploring [[Living Digital Gardens]]

**The idea is to [[notes/epiphanies/transmigration|encode myself]] into offline [[tutorials/Generative QR Codes|Generative QR Codes]] that spawn agentic mixed realities sustained by crypto. Technically they are [[Virtual Network States]] but I like calling them "[[Living Digital Gardens]]" because they are grounded in your dataverse**

## Why it will work

> **Extending reality is possible:**
>- it's possible to augment reality
> - it's possible to create your own mesh network
>- it's possible to trade crypto through mesh networks
>- it's possible to vibe code any interface you need for any data
>- it's possible to use mesh networked crypto to run a Network State
>- this can happen agentically

## How it will work

>  **You can bootstrap realities with QR Codes:**
> - it's possible to create [[tutorials/Generative QR Codes|Generative QR Codes]]
>- it's possible to create generative [[Mesh Networks|mesh networked]] qr codes
>- it's possible for qr codes to generate [[WebXR]] experiences
>- it's possible to make qr codes by hand
>- it's possible to make qr codes from literally dirt

**Therefore from literally the dirt on the ground you can bootstrap a real-alternate reality with augmented ‚Å†[[Embodied Symbients]] that interface with physical reality**

## Funding Goals
- $500 to bootstrap "[[Living Digital Gardens]]"
	- Thermal printer for [[tutorials/Generative QR Codes|Generative QR Codes]]
	- API costs
- $5k to cover my [[extended reality]] research goals
	- 3D Printers and supplies
	- Extended reality equipment (projector, AR glasses)
- $50k would give me financial agency
	- Start local meetup group
	- Attend/host conferences
- $250k so I can start a [[robot commune]] and research/residency center
	- Down payment on land
	- A few humanoid robots/drones to practice with
